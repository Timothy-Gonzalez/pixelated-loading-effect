# Usage
Simply add the `pixelatedLoadingEffect` class to any image, and the magic will be done.

## Configuration
There are two custom CSS properties you can edit to configure the result:
- `--time` - The time is takes for the effect to finish. Default `1s`. Demo is at `1s`.
- `--delay` - The time before the effect begins. Default `0s`. Demo is at `1s`.
